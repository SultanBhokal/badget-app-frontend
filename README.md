after deciding budget, You can add categories to divide your budget.

Now i have provided dashboard type page where you can add your limit edit limit, add and delete categories , add and delete expenses
etc.

you can view your expanses of current budget.

I will provide a history option where you can see all the past budget expenses and its categories.

I have used boostrap-5 react , styled-components , framer-motion etc to create and design components and provide some
cool animation to it.
